# 🧩 Proxy Server Types

This document explains the main types of Proxy Servers and their core functions.

---

## 🔹 1. Forward Proxy
Acts as a middleman between a client and the internet.  
It hides the client’s IP address and can cache data, filter content, and monitor traffic.

**Use Cases:**
- Anonymity and privacy
- Content filtering in companies
- Internet access control

---

## 🔹 2. Reverse Proxy
Placed in front of servers to handle client requests before they reach the backend servers.  
It can distribute load, protect servers, and improve performance.

**Use Cases:**
- Load balancing
- Hiding internal servers
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)

---

## 🔹 3. Transparent Proxy
Does not modify requests or hide IP addresses.  
Clients often don’t know they are behind a proxy.

**Use Cases:**
- Network monitoring
- Content control in public or corporate networks

---

## 🔹 4. Anonymous Proxy
Hides the client’s IP but reveals that it is a proxy.

**Use Cases:**
- Moderate privacy protection

---

## 🔹 5. High Anonymity (Elite) Proxy
Completely hides the client’s IP and does not reveal that it’s a proxy.

**Use Cases:**
- Maximum privacy and anonymity
