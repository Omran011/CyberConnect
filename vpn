# What is a VPN

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology used to create a secure and encrypted connection between your device and the internet. Think of it as a private tunnel for your data, preventing others from spying on your online activities.

## Benefits

* Hides your real IP address.
* Encrypts data during transmission.
* Bypasses geo-restrictions.
* Protects your privacy on public Wi-Fi networks.

---

## How It Works

1. Your device establishes an encrypted connection with a VPN server.
2. All your internet traffic is routed through this server.
3. Websites and services see the server's IP instead of your real one.

## Common Protocols

* OpenVPN
* WireGuard
* IKEv2/IPSec

## Example: Simple WireGuard Configuration

[Interface]
PrivateKey = <client_private_key>
Address = 10.0.0.2/24
DNS = 1.1.1.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = <server_public_key>
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
Endpoint = vpn.example.com:51820
PersistentKeepalive = 25

## Bash Script to Generate WireGuard Keys

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

OUT_DIR="wireguard-keys"
mkdir -p "$OUT_DIR"

wg genkey | tee "$OUT_DIR/privatekey" | wg pubkey > "$OUT_DIR/publickey"

echo "Keys have been generated in: $OUT_DIR"
cat "$OUT_DIR/publickey"

## Security Tips

* Never share your private keys.

* Keep your VPN software up to date.
